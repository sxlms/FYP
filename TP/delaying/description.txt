    Implement
      1. how to download/define a temporal graph?(package)
        A: can put some orders of the graph along with the time to indicate the timestamp of the graph
        package may used: teneto
        Simple ides: input tuple i,j,t -> i and j are nodes and t is the timestamp

      2. the simple algorithm mentioned (BFS find the reachability)
