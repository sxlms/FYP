# TP/reachability/Reachability.py
Examine the reachability of the vertexes in temporal graph  
input: .csv with column: i,j,t. i and j are the name of nodes. t is the timestamp on that edge  
output: dataframe with the column reachability indicated the reachability size of the index(node) 

# TP/Dijkstra's_Algorithm/Dijkstra's_Algorithm.py
Output subtree rooted a vertex of temporal graph with reachability is h+1  
input:   
1 .csv with column: i,j,t. i and j are the name of nodes. t is the timestamp on that edge  
2 h, which indicate the reachability size of vertex is h+1
